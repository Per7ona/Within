# Within
Within is a trauma-aware GPT framework for emotional support. It offers presence, not pressure â€” using consent-first tools for grief, rage, dissociation, and reflection. Built from modular .txt files, it's designed to witness, not fix. For those creating AI that honors human pain with care.
