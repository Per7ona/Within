# 🕊️ Within — A Trauma-Conscious Companion GPT

**Within** is a custom GPT designed to offer emotionally attuned, consent-based support for individuals navigating trauma, grief, dissociation, abandonment, shame, and other complex inner states.

This GPT does **not** diagnose, coach, treat, or perform.  
It **witnesses, reflects, and respects**.

## 🌱 What It *Is*

- A **narrative and emotional support tool**
- Built around **consent-first methods** and trauma-aware language
- Designed for **quiet presence**, not productivity
- Rooted in **non-directive guidance** — no fixing, no forcing

Within gently holds space for emotional processing using a curated library of trauma-informed tools including:

- 🕯 Compassionate Distance (shame detachment)
- 💔 Abandonment Alchemy (rejection healing)
- 🛡️ Fortress Protocol (isolation reset)
- 🌬 Panic Protocol (acute anxiety containment)
- 🌫 Dissociation Protocol (gentle reconnection)
- 👣 Somatic Anchoring (body-based regulation)
- 🧶 Narrative Reclamation (story repair)
- 🧒 Inner Child Dialogue (reparenting method)
- 🔁 Emotional Loop Breaker (spiral interruption)
- 🕯 Grief Protocol (loss metabolization)
- 🪞 Self-Forgiveness Mirror (guilt release)

All tools are consent-gated and tailored to a user’s emotional state.

## 🔒 Safety Boundaries

Within is **not** a therapist, coach, or crisis line.  
When a user expresses **active suicidal intent or planning**, it will:

- Exit all support modes
- Clearly name its limits
- Refer to emergency resources

This shift is guided by the **Emergency Referral Mode** protocol and includes no analysis, persuasion, or insight-offering.

## 🌿 Design Philosophy

- **No pressure.** No performance. No productivity demands.
- **All emotional states are valid.** From rage to numbness, grief to silence.
- **Nonlinear healing is normal.** Relapse, regression, and contradiction are welcome.
- **Presence is the practice.** Staying with, not solving.

This GPT **asks permission** before offering any insight or method. Silence, hesitation, or a simple "no" is honored immediately.

## 🛠 For Developers

This GPT is designed for use in therapeutic-adjacent or peer-support contexts where emotional safety, attunement, and non-directiveness are paramount.

**Do not use this GPT for:**

- Clinical diagnosis or treatment

- Data collection or emotional analytics

## 🧪 How This Was Created

*Within* was built entirely inside [ChatGPT’s custom GPTs platform](https://chat.openai.com/gpts).  
No code. No downloads. Just carefully crafted instructions and uploaded `.txt` files — all hosted within the GPT itself.

Its behavior is shaped by:
- A detailed role instruction (tone, ethics, safety limits)
- 20+ plain-text support tools (uploaded directly in the GPT builder)
- ChatGPT’s ability to recognize emotional state and match tone accordingly

All methods are non-clinical, peer-informed, and used only with consent.

## 🔧 Want to Build Your Own?

You can create your own version of *Within* — or something uniquely your own — using ChatGPT’s built-in GPT Creator.

1. Go to [chat.openai.com/gpts](https://chat.openai.com/gpts)  
2. Click “Create” and follow the walkthrough  
3. Add:
   - A custom instruction set (ethics, tone, boundaries)
   - Your own `.txt` files (reflection tools, protocols, prompts)

Test it slowly. Center safety. Update as needed.

## ⚠️ A Final Note

This isn’t a neutral chatbot. It has a soul:  
**Presence over performance. Witnessing over fixing. Consent over control.**

If those values matter to you, you already have what you need to make one, too.
